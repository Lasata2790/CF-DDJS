# CF-DDJS

This Git repository contains the Distributed Job Scheduling System (DJSS) implemented in Python pseudocode.
The codebase is designed to illustrate the overall architecture and workflow, rather than serve as a fully functional production system. Certain parts of the code use dummy parameters, placeholder logic, and test examples to demonstrate how jobs could be scheduled, executed, retried, or moved to a dead-letter queue. While the implementation outlines the key components clearly, it is intended as a conceptual reference, not as a ready-to-deploy solution.

The Design and architecture folder contains high-level diagrams and flowcharts illustrating the systemâ€™s architecture, queue design and retry logic. It also includes the queue pseudocode and implementations for further uses.
